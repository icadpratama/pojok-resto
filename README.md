# Restaurant Management System - OOP and Design Patterns in Java

This guide covers the fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and design patterns applied to a restaurant management system. It includes designing core classes, implementing relationships, and using various design patterns for efficient solutions. 

## 1. Introduction to OOP Concepts with Real-World Mapping

### Classes and Objects
Define essential classes like:
- `MenuItem`
- `Order`
- `Ingredient`
- `Employee`
- `Table`

### Encapsulation
Hide internal details and expose only relevant information, for example:
- In the `MenuItem` class, use getters and setters for properties like `name`, `category`, and `price`.

### Inheritance
Create base classes and specific subclasses. For example:
- An `Employee` base class with subclasses for roles such as `Chef`, `Waiter`, and `Manager`.

### Polymorphism
Implement method overriding:
- The `Order` class has a method `calculateTotal`, which is overridden by specific order types like `DineInOrder` and `TakeoutOrder`.

### Abstraction
Define interfaces or abstract classes for shared behavior. For example:
- An interface `Discountable` for classes that support discounts, like `Order` or `Reservation`.

## 2. Designing Core Classes with Relationships

### Customer and Employee Classes
Design `Customer` and `Employee` classes with properties and methods that reflect their real-world roles.

### Menu and Modifier Classes
Create `MenuItem` and `Modifier` classes:
- The `MenuItem` class can hold a list of applicable `Modifier` objects, allowing for customization.

### Order and OrderDetail Classes
Develop an `Order` class containing `OrderDetail` objects:
- Each `OrderDetail` links to a `MenuItem` with modifiers applied, allowing for specific item customizations in an order.

## 3. Using Design Patterns for Effective Solutions

### Creational Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern**: Implement a singleton for `DatabaseConnection` to ensure a single, shared database connection across the application.
- **Factory Pattern**: Use a factory for creating `Order` objects depending on the order type (e.g., `DineInOrder`, `TakeoutOrder`, `DeliveryOrder`).
- **Builder Pattern**: Implement a builder for complex classes like `Order` or `Reservation`, where object creation may involve many optional parameters.

### Structural Patterns

- **Decorator Pattern**: Use a decorator to dynamically add functionality to `MenuItem` objects, such as adding special discounts or customization options.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Integrate external payment APIs using an adapter that wraps various payment providers in a standard interface.
- **Composite Pattern**: Model table arrangements using composite patterns to handle grouping tables for large parties (e.g., merging two tables together).

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Apply the observer pattern for inventory management, allowing `Order` objects to notify `Inventory` when ingredients are used so `Inventory` can update stock levels.
- **Command Pattern**: Implement commands for order actions (e.g., `PlaceOrder`, `CancelOrder`, `ModifyOrder`). This pattern helps manage complex actions and undo operations.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Use a strategy for different discount calculations on orders (e.g., percentage-based, flat-rate) or various loyalty levels for customers.
- **State Pattern**: Use a state pattern for `Order` and `Reservation` statuses (e.g., `Pending`, `Confirmed`, `Completed`). This allows dynamic state transitions and rules for each state.

## 4. UML and Class Diagrams

Design UML diagrams for the classes and their relationships to visualize system interactions. Diagrams to create:
- Core entities like `Order`, `Customer`, and `Table`.
- Relationships between `MenuItem` and `Modifier` classes.
- Order handling and inventory management flows.

## 5. Exception Handling and Data Validation

Implement exception handling in classes, especially in critical areas like order processing and stock management. Apply validation strategies for class constructors and methods to ensure data integrity:
- For instance, ensuring that `quantity` in `OrderDetails` is always positive.

## 6. Testing and Mocking Frameworks

- Write unit tests for key classes and methods, such as `calculateTotal` in `Order`, to verify calculations.
- Use mocking frameworks like Mockito for testing database interactions or other dependencies in the application.

## 1. Getting Started with Spring Boot

- **Introduction to Spring Boot**: Understand the basics of Spring Boot and its role in simplifying Java application development.
- **Setting Up Your Spring Boot Project**: Use Spring Initializr to create a new project with essential dependencies (e.g., Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 or MySQL Database).
- **Spring Boot Annotations**: Learn about key annotations like `@SpringBootApplication`, `@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Autowired`.

## 2. Building Core Components with Spring Boot

- **Modeling Entities with JPA**: Define entities such as `Customer`, `Employee`, `MenuItem`, `Order`, `OrderDetail`, and `Modifier` using JPA annotations.
- **Creating Repositories**: Use `JpaRepository` to create repositories for CRUD operations on entities.
- **Service Layer**: Implement a service layer to manage business logic for core entities, such as `CustomerService` and `OrderService`.
- **Controller Layer**: Set up RESTful controllers to handle HTTP requests, including `CustomerController` and `OrderController`.

## 3. Working with Databases in Spring Boot

- **Database Configuration**: Configure Spring Boot for databases like H2 (for in-memory testing) or MySQL, using `spring.datasource` properties in `application.properties`.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Use Spring Data JPA to simplify database access and manage CRUD operations on entities.
- **Using Flyway or Liquibase for Database Migration**: Manage database schema changes across environments with Flyway or Liquibase.

## 4. Applying Design Patterns with Spring Boot

### Creational Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern for Database Connection**: Utilize Spring’s dependency injection to create singleton-scoped beans, ensuring a single `DatabaseConnection` instance.
- **Factory Pattern for Order Creation**: Implement a factory for creating different `Order` types (`DineInOrder`, `TakeoutOrder`, `DeliveryOrder`) as Spring beans.
- **Builder Pattern with Lombok**: Use Lombok’s `@Builder` annotation to simplify building complex objects like `Order` or `Reservation`.

### Structural Patterns

- **Decorator Pattern for MenuItem**: Use a decorator pattern to add functionality to `MenuItem` objects, such as applying discounts or customization. Implement decorators as Spring beans for flexibility.
- **Adapter Pattern for Payment Integration**: Create adapters for various payment providers, using a common `PaymentService` interface to integrate payment providers like `Stripe` and `PayPal`.
- **Composite Pattern for Table Management**: Model composite table structures by grouping tables for large parties, following the composite pattern.

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer Pattern for Inventory Management**: Use Spring’s `ApplicationEvent` and `@EventListener` to notify the `Inventory` service when orders affect stock levels.
- **Command Pattern for Order Actions**: Implement commands for actions like `PlaceOrder`, `CancelOrder`, and `ModifyOrder`, and execute them in a transaction context.
- **Strategy Pattern for Discounts**: Implement a strategy pattern for different discount calculations on orders using a `DiscountStrategy` interface, with classes for `PercentageDiscount` and `FlatDiscount`.
- **State Pattern for Order Status**: Manage dynamic transitions of order and reservation statuses (e.g., `Pending`, `Confirmed`, `Completed`) with Spring to inject state beans based on the current order status.

## 5. Exception Handling and Validation in Spring Boot

- **Exception Handling with @ControllerAdvice**: Use `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler` to manage global exception handling across controllers.
- **Data Validation with Spring Boot**: Apply validation annotations like `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Pattern`, and `@Min` for entity validation. Use `@Valid` in controller request objects to ensure data integrity.

## 6. Securing the Application

- **Spring Security Basics**: Learn Spring Security, configuring authentication and authorization for roles such as `Admin`, `Employee`, and `Customer`.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication**: Implement JWT-based authentication to secure REST APIs.
- **Method-Level Security**: Use `@PreAuthorize` and `@Secured` annotations to restrict access to specific methods based on user roles.

## 7. Advanced Topics

- **Event-Driven Architecture with Spring Events**: Use `ApplicationEventPublisher` and `@EventListener` to manage asynchronous events, such as sending notifications on order updates.
- **Scheduling with Spring**: Use `@Scheduled` annotations for recurring tasks, like updating inventory levels or sending reminders for upcoming reservations.
- **Caching with Spring Cache**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data like menu items or customer information to enhance performance.

## 8. Testing in Spring Boot

- **Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito**: Write unit tests for services and controllers using JUnit and Mockito.
- **Integration Testing with Spring Boot Test**: Use `@SpringBootTest` for integration tests, verifying interactions between components.
- **Mocking Repositories**: Use Mockito to mock repositories for isolated service tests.
