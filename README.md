# Restaurant Management System - OOP and Design Patterns in Java

This guide covers the fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and design patterns applied to a restaurant management system. It includes designing core classes, implementing relationships, and using various design patterns for efficient solutions. 

## 1. Introduction to OOP Concepts with Real-World Mapping

### Classes and Objects
Define essential classes like:
- `MenuItem`
- `Order`
- `Ingredient`
- `Employee`
- `Table`

### Encapsulation
Hide internal details and expose only relevant information, for example:
- In the `MenuItem` class, use getters and setters for properties like `name`, `category`, and `price`.

### Inheritance
Create base classes and specific subclasses. For example:
- An `Employee` base class with subclasses for roles such as `Chef`, `Waiter`, and `Manager`.

### Polymorphism
Implement method overriding:
- The `Order` class has a method `calculateTotal`, which is overridden by specific order types like `DineInOrder` and `TakeoutOrder`.

### Abstraction
Define interfaces or abstract classes for shared behavior. For example:
- An interface `Discountable` for classes that support discounts, like `Order` or `Reservation`.

## 2. Designing Core Classes with Relationships

### Customer and Employee Classes
Design `Customer` and `Employee` classes with properties and methods that reflect their real-world roles.

### Menu and Modifier Classes
Create `MenuItem` and `Modifier` classes:
- The `MenuItem` class can hold a list of applicable `Modifier` objects, allowing for customization.

### Order and OrderDetail Classes
Develop an `Order` class containing `OrderDetail` objects:
- Each `OrderDetail` links to a `MenuItem` with modifiers applied, allowing for specific item customizations in an order.

## 3. Using Design Patterns for Effective Solutions

### Creational Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern**: Implement a singleton for `DatabaseConnection` to ensure a single, shared database connection across the application.
- **Factory Pattern**: Use a factory for creating `Order` objects depending on the order type (e.g., `DineInOrder`, `TakeoutOrder`, `DeliveryOrder`).
- **Builder Pattern**: Implement a builder for complex classes like `Order` or `Reservation`, where object creation may involve many optional parameters.

### Structural Patterns

- **Decorator Pattern**: Use a decorator to dynamically add functionality to `MenuItem` objects, such as adding special discounts or customization options.
- **Adapter Pattern**: Integrate external payment APIs using an adapter that wraps various payment providers in a standard interface.
- **Composite Pattern**: Model table arrangements using composite patterns to handle grouping tables for large parties (e.g., merging two tables together).

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Apply the observer pattern for inventory management, allowing `Order` objects to notify `Inventory` when ingredients are used so `Inventory` can update stock levels.
- **Command Pattern**: Implement commands for order actions (e.g., `PlaceOrder`, `CancelOrder`, `ModifyOrder`). This pattern helps manage complex actions and undo operations.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Use a strategy for different discount calculations on orders (e.g., percentage-based, flat-rate) or various loyalty levels for customers.
- **State Pattern**: Use a state pattern for `Order` and `Reservation` statuses (e.g., `Pending`, `Confirmed`, `Completed`). This allows dynamic state transitions and rules for each state.

## 4. UML and Class Diagrams

Design UML diagrams for the classes and their relationships to visualize system interactions. Diagrams to create:
- Core entities like `Order`, `Customer`, and `Table`.
- Relationships between `MenuItem` and `Modifier` classes.
- Order handling and inventory management flows.

## 5. Exception Handling and Data Validation

Implement exception handling in classes, especially in critical areas like order processing and stock management. Apply validation strategies for class constructors and methods to ensure data integrity:
- For instance, ensuring that `quantity` in `OrderDetails` is always positive.

## 6. Testing and Mocking Frameworks

- Write unit tests for key classes and methods, such as `calculateTotal` in `Order`, to verify calculations.
- Use mocking frameworks like Mockito for testing database interactions or other dependencies in the application.
